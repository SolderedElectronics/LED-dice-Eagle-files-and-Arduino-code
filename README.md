## Description and details
LED dice is simple & easy way to get into soldering. While learning to solder, you will also create unique gadget which you can carry around. Board is powered by small CR2032 battery and the brain of circuit Atmel Attiny85 microcontroller.

Feel free to bump into code! We are looking to implement sleep function for Attiny85 to save battery power.

## Repository content
This repo contains Cadsoft Eagle .sch and .brd files for LED dice PCB board. It also contains schematic in .pdf created from .sch Eagle file. 
Files have been arranged into folders for navigating between different versions of board. 
Tip: layer 200 shows top silkscreen and layer 208 should be bottom silkscreen. tParts and bParts layers are not used.
There is also a firmware folder in which you can find Arduino code for microcontroller.
